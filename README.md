Hi! 👋 My name is Arjun Singh. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, from Hansraj College, University of Delhi. 🎓

I have been passionate about 👷 building stuff for a long time, and that's what got me into programming and development. 💻

I am currently experienced with web development. Lately, I have been looking to involve popular technologies into my tech stack, including Docker, AWS, TypeScript, tRPC etc. 🚀 I am also interested in learning about the human aspects of software development: branching strategies, software lifecycle methodologies, knowledge management, resource sharing etc. 🌐

I have also been a [guest writer for CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/getting-started-with-wordpress-block-development/). ✍️
