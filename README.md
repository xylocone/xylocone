Hi! My name is Arjun Singh. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, from Hansraj College, University of Delhi.
I have been passionate about _building_ stuff for a long time, and that's what got me into programming and development.

I am currently experienced with web development. Lately, I have been looking to involve popular technologies into my tech stack, including Docker, AWS, TypeScript, tRPC etc. I am also interested in learning about the human aspects of software development: branching strategies, software lifecycle methodologies, knowledge management, resource sharing etc.

I have also been a guest writer for CSS-Tricks.
